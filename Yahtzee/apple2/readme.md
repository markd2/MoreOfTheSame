# Apple 2 Yahtzee

First version of the first project in this repo.  yay me.

Using **Apple Commander** (https://applecommander.github.io) for accessing the goodies off of the committed disk image.

Extract the Applesoft program with something like:

```
% ~/bin/ac-mac-aarch64-13.0 -e Yahtzee.DO PROGRAM_NAME > blah.bas.txt
```

To see the latest (extracted) code, [check it out](yahtzee.bas)

Program development on an actual Apple 2 with a BMOW [Floopy Emu](https://shop.bigmessowires.com/products/floppy-emu-model-c) instead of physical disks.

Program playback animations via [Virtual //](https://www.virtualii.com)


## It works!
