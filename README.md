# MoreOfTheSame

The same thing(s), but written in different ways.

Now that I have More Time, I'm probably going to be implementing similar
things in different ways.  I know I'm going to want some side-by-side
modern language vs BASIC over at [Modern Retro(e)](https://github.com/markd2/Modern-Retro).
Plus there's some things, say like a Yahtzeeâ„¢ style dice game, in different ways.
Like BASIC (for Applesoft BASIC), Swift (for iPhong), and Lua (for Playdate).  Might make
a fun compare-and-contrast. Or might not. Could be totally pointless, and you,
poor reader, looking at this 9 year old README in a repo with seventeen commits.  I shall
weep for you.
